>  An enhanced application enable students to learn more proactively with 3d designs in the science fields, AR-based application that allow the user to interact with the models and do labâ€™s experiments.  [Landing  Page](https://educator-ar.netlify.app/)


## Features
- It provides additional learning materials to improve their learning experience through an interactive way. 
- AR-based application that uses the marker-based technique to scan the marker and display the 3D model
- Exploring 3D models for elements and reactions in chemistry, geology and biology.
- Generate All Perodic Elements 3d model with only its Atomic number.
- Provide learning materials and information about some elements.
- Provide the ability to zoom in and out through the 3D models and move them.
- Allow evaluation for students through getting quizzes to test their knowledge.
